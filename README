Raspberry Pi 2 model B

IMPORTANT!! Sudo shutdown -h now
Need to shut off the RP, directly unplugging the power cord might corrupt the pi.

Useful Commands:
python3 file.py: For running python files

Sudo raspi-config: Opens the configuration settings menu

free -h: For checking info on RAM

sudo apt-get -y install python3-rpi.gpio: For resolving an issue when using PWM. GPIO conflicts with LGPIO 

time g++ file.cc: time command outputs the runtime of a file

sudo apt-get install fail2ban: Limits the amount of password attempts and greatly improves security
